1.  **Determine the minimum attributes needed for the primary key.**
    * The minimum attributes for the primary key are: **`{StudentID, CourseCode, Semester}`**.

2.  **Explain why each attribute in your primary key is necessary.**
    * **`StudentID`**: Distinguishes between different students taking the same course.
    * **`CourseCode`**: Distinguishes between different courses taken by the same student.
    * **`Semester`**: Distinguishes between a student taking the same course in different semesters. The business rule "a student can take the same course in different semesters" makes this attribute essential.

3.  **Identify any additional candidate keys (if they exist).**
    * Based on the provided business rules, there are **no additional candidate keys**. The combination of `StudentID`, `CourseCode`, and `Semester` is the only minimal set of attributes that guarantees a unique registration record.
